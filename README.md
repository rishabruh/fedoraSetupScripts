# fedoraSetupScripts
**!!Scripts are made for my own use but you are free to fork and modify as you like (probably not a good idea these scripts are badly written)!!**
# Info
Fedora setup scripts. These scripts can be easily customised for installing preferred packages.
# How to use
>Caution: Never execute random scripts from the internet unless you trust the source. Be sure to check the scripts for yourself in a text editor before executing.

1) Download the code to a zip file and extract it into a folder.
2) Right click in your file manager and open that directory in the terminal.
3) Now give execution permissions to these scripts. Use
```$ chmod +x [script name]```
4) Now execute the script with
```$ ./[script name]```
(If the terminal gives a permission-related error, add "sudo" before the command.)
5) Enter your sudo password when required.
6) Done!
